<p>Hello
These days, it’s a rare thing to see Nims face defeat. Over the past four years, the former Nepalese special forces soldier has electrified the climbing world and the wider culture beyond. He became mega-famous in 2019 by scaling all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter peaks in just six months and six days. After that inventive feat, his notoriety was multiplied by the releases of his book, Beyond Possible, and Netflix movie, 14 Peaks, both of which helped confer a level of power on Nims that climbers seldom achieve. Now he’s deciding how to wield that influence, both for himself and his Sherpa compatriots. He’s aimed at nothing less than remaking the Himalayan guiding industry in his image—and along the way is raising questions about what it means to be a mountaineer in the age of the influencer.

Having arranged to meet Nims at his camp at the base of Ama Dablam, where he was leading his final Himalayan expedition of the year, I’d flown by helicopter from Kathmandu to the roadless Sherpa capital of Namche Bazaar, located at just over 11,000 feet. From there, it was a three-day walk up Nepal’s Khumbu Valley to the tent city occupied by Elite Exped, which Nims operates with two Sherpa business partners, Mingma David and Mingma Tenzi. Roughly two dozen clients had ponied up about $11,000 each to share a rope with one of Nims’s Sherpa guides on the 25-day expedition, which would involve about a week of acclimatization followed by a grueling two-day summit push. In addition to Elite, there were a dozen or so other outfitters on the mountain, but the teams didn’t mix. Like the fancy camps at Burning Man, Elite was roped off with tasteful signs advising “No entry.”

Dominating camp were a pair of 30-foot-tall dome tents, inside which the climbers took their meals. At dinner that night, Nims sat at the head of a T-shaped banquet table in one of the two domes. He gave a weather report and dispensed customized summit plans for each client-Sherpa team from memory. He was surrounded by his patrons, among them several jovial, square-jawed British special-forces alums of the sort who now have successful life-hacking podcasts and large social media followings. Propane heaters purred, and a dozen of his climbers—the ones not currently acclimatizing higher up the mountain—sat noshing in comfortable armchairs. 

There was Madison Loyola, an athletic former LDS 30-something with a successful manufacturing company. Kayla Perez, a private-jet flight attendant had googled “how to climb a mountain” early in the pandemic; now she was here. Michael Green was a Vancouver-based architect who’d figured out how to build timber skyscrapers and gave a TED talk about it, with over a million views. 

After dinner, the Sherpas cranked up a local Nepali DJ named Badal and the scene phase-changed into a full-blown dance party. A fifth of rum appeared and Nims filled everyone’s cups. Green, the architect, leaned over and assured me, “This is every night.”

“I don’t care what you do,” Nims later said of his policy on both clients and employees getting turnt. “But next day if you can’t operate, that’s your fuckup.” 

Nims danced for a half-hour, dropping into thigh-crushing Cossack leg kicks at one point, and then settled into a chair with a mug. Earlier in the day he’d been irritated that a French climber had died during his descent, and that his outfitter hadn’t called Nims to ask for help. “If only they had told my team, ‘Could you give us a hand?’ ” Nims lamented, referring to the staff of 46 able-bodied men in camp. “I have such huge manpower here.”

Nims typically has a knack for being near the center of the action. His photo of a traffic jam of hundreds of climbers queuing near Everest’s summit in 2019 became an international news story, as were his many rescues of other climbers that same season. Last September, he organized the recovery of American ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson’s body after she died falling from the summit of Manaslu, the world’s eighth-tallest peak. 

But this time, there was nothing he could do. The guides had gotten the Frenchman off the mountain, but he expired before they could reach a waiting helicopter. The incident had prompted Nims to reflect on his own safety record.

“Thirty-two 8,000-meter expeditions, my brother,” he boasted. “All summits. Brought everybody back home exactly the same way they left. Probably fitter and with a better mental attitude. No one in the world has got that track record. I say that with pride.”

In 2021 Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of...
In 2021, Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of bottled oxygen.
Nims projects the kind of confidence that isn’t long suffered by these mountains. But what happens when someone does die? How would he respond to that?

“No one should die,” Nims insisted. “There’s no What if? bro.” For Nims, this absolute belief seems less like denial than the daily affirmations of a man who makes Norman Vincent Peale look like a whiner. Nims has a lot of care for his clients and holds his Sherpa team in the highest regard. 

He believes he’s carrying more than their safety on his back.

He nodded to the Sherpa guys still dancing. “I’m the fucking face of these people, bro,” he said. “You’ll see it everywhere in Kathmandu. I’m their hope now.”

Indeed, his name was everywhere in Kathmandu, like a flickering signal resolving from the noise of interstellar static. A wobble in an orbit. A telltale shift in wavelength. A new and powerful force had taken hold here: Nimsdai. In sleek black sans serif on the hood of the custom white Land Rover that fetched me from Tribhuvan airport: Nimsdai.

Those same seven letters appeared above the glass-and-steel shopping pavilion annexed to the five-star Marriott that sprang up in the brief interlude between the 2015 earthquake, which killed nearly 9,000 Nepalis, and the pandemic, which took an additional 12,000. Nimsdai is both the flagship mountaineering store above the Apple computer retailer in that square, and the diminutive Nepali call sign of the man whose name is on every Himalayan climber’s lips: Nirmal Purja a.k.a. Nims Purja a.k.a. Nimsdai.

It means “Brother Nims.” He is family. He is a demigod. He is the second coming of Tenzing Norgay. Only this time, instead of politely supporting his Edmund Hillary, he takes the credit and razzes the best foreign climbers for drafting behind him and his Sherpa crew. 

Though he is now in possession of a British passport, Nims was once a barefoot ethnic Magar kid, running in the sweltering streets of Chitwan, near the Indian border. He was one of those uniformed boarding-school boys walking arm-in-arm in the road, dressed in a striped tie and a blue cardigan. That was before he joined the Gurkhas, the legendary Nepali infantrymen established by the British Empire, and then, through sheer force of will, became the first Nepali elevated to the Special Boat Service, the Royal Navy’s version of the SEALs. This, despite Nepal’s nonexistent coastline.

Nims started out humble. The humility wore off. Like the punch line to that joke about how you know there’s a Navy SEAL in the room: He tells you of his deeds, his world records, his daring rescues. He has compared himself to Muhammad Ali, Usain Bolt, Neil Armstrong, and Robin Hood, and speaks slogan-ese with a fluency that could reanimate Ron Popeil. Achieve your new possible! Always a little higher! Giving up is not in the blood! These and other phrases are printed on everything from coffee cups to the mission patches Nims velcros to the one-piece down summit suits worn by his mountaineer clients. 

He says he’s the CEO of nine companies, though he won’t name them all. His book and movie are both autobiographical. The former, a best seller, reads like the kind of memoir written by American politicians who have suddenly taken to vacationing in Iowa. The latter, Nims says, was Netflix’s most popular release of 2021. He gets consistent corporate speaking gigs, and his one-on-one guiding rate up Everest is, he told me, more than a million dollars.

It’s a lot. Nims is a lot. But his hustle and bravado are precisely the things that have allowed him to break into the mainstream from Nepal’s deep bench of climbing talent. I’ve covered mountaineering and Sherpa culture on and off for more than a decade, and while there have always been insanely strong climbers with roots in Nepal, nobody has ever amassed the mind share, as the marketers say, that Nims has. In the process he’s gathered a legion of devotees and plenty of critics, all of them hoping to cement his reputation as either a generational talent among high-altitude mountaineers or else an egotistical self-promoter flying perilously close to the sun.

I found it impossible to escape these questions in Kathmandu as I prepared to go meet the man himself. At the airport, I made my way beneath the rotors of an AStar B3, noticing before I climbed aboard that it was wrapped in now familiar black lettering: Nimsdai. 

The heli put me down in Namche Bazaar, which sits in an airy amphitheater of hillside high above the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and Bhote Koshi rivers. From a ridgeline above town, I could see Ama Dablam—“mother’s necklace”—a granite pinnacle adorned with a hundred-ton pendant of ice near its western crown. Farther in the background rises the squat pyramid of Everest, at 29,032 feet. Chomolungma, as the Sherpas call it, isn’t the prettiest, but it’s so high that it juts into the jet stream and makes a rooster tail in the stratosphere, like it’s clawing at space itself. 

Walking the dusty trail beside these mountains produces a kind of vertigo of naked scale. They follow you the way the moon does—Thamserku, Taboche, Cholatse. The path feels stationary, like a treadmill. For most of us, Himalayan peaks merely inspire awe. But to an unfortunate subset of climbers, they’re as irresistible as a wobbly bookcase is to a toddler. The tallest 14 of the world’s summits, through a chance intersection of geology and the metric system, are known as the 8,000’ers. Above 8,000 meters—about 26,000 feet—your body can no longer adapt to the thinness of the air. This is the Death Zone. You can’t stay here long.

It was on these 14 peaks—all of them located in the Himalayan uplift in the border regions of Nepal, Tibet, and Pakistan—that Nims first blew minds. The Death Zone peaks are roughly sorted into three groups, based on those international borders. In Nepal: Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Manaslu. In the Pakistani Karakoram, 900 miles to the north and much colder: Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I and II, K2, and Broad Peak. Lastly, along Nepal’s border with Tibet: Cho Oyu and Shishapangma.

He’d first begun climbing at altitude in 2012, at the age of 29, and four years later reached the summit of Everest as an anonymous client while on leave from the U.K. Special Forces. Then, in 2019, having previously climbed only four of the Death Zone peaks, Nims summited all 14 in just six months and six days. He called it Project Possible, because people who know about such things told him it couldn’t be done. The previous record was a brisk but sensible seven years—one expedition in each of the spring and fall climbing seasons, between the monsoons and the frigid winter.

Bagging Himalayan peaks as if they were day-trip outings was unheard of. The movie Nims shot and produced debuted on Netflix in November 2021 and elevated Nims and his Sherpa team to social media celebrity status. The film also generated huge international publicity for Elite Exped. By mid-2022 Nims had over 2 million followers on Instagram. He also had a client list that he said included numerous billionaires, whose names he won’t reveal, and one Qatari princess, Asma Al Thani, who appears frequently in his feed.

On the way to meet Nims, I sent a WhatsApp message to Garrett Madison, an American outfitter on Ama Dablam that fall, letting him know that I was coming. “Just visited Nims’s camp today,” Madison replied. “Only three models this time 😂.” Was Madison worried that Nimsdai and his Elite Exped would swallow up the entire Himalayan guiding industry? Not quite. It’s a “different vibe,” Madison responded. “Interesting ‘new market’ of clientele. Not my competition, so all good. A rising tide lifts all boats.”

The models Madison was referring to were known collectively as the @SwissAlpineGirls. When I rolled into base camp, they were with another Elite detachment over on Lobuche East, a nearby 6,100-meter peak that Nims often advises novices to tackle as their first Himalayan ascent. Among the other clients on Lobuche was Andrew Shaw, who calls himself a “well-being engineer.” Nims’s appeal seems especially strong among the aesthetically inclined, probably due in part to his outsize digital footprint.

But if the social media set was drawn to Nims, the climbing world wasn’t sure what to do with him. Mountaineers knew that Nims had accomplished something significant, but they couldn’t agree on what exactly that was. He had used some of the accoutrements frowned upon by purists, including bottled oxygen and fixed ropes, and had a team of Sherpas guide him in the way that a pace line of seasoned domestiques slices through wind resistance for the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. 

Krzysztof Wielicki, the legendary Polish mountaineer who in 1980 became the first to climb Everest in winter, told a Polish radio station, “It’s more of a statistical achievement,” adding that the feat would not be “written into the history of alpine climbing.” 

He felt that others had summited the 14 peaks in a far more impressive fashion, among them the South Tyrolean great Reinhold Messner, now 78, who achieved the feat in 16 years without fixed ropes or bottled oxygen, and the late Pole Jerzy Kukuczka, who pulled it off in eight years and used oxygen only on Everest. “It is light-years short of Kukuczka and Messner’s class,” Wielicki said of Nims’s Project Possible. 

But he failed to grasp the significance of Nims’s innovation, like the guy who stands in front of a Pollock and says, “My kid could do that.” Filmmaker and climber Jimmy Chin points out that while it is a logistical feat, “It’s way more than that…. You still have to climb the mountains”—often in bad weather.

The fact is, before Nims did it in 189 days, nobody had even considered attempting a fastest known time (FKT) on the 8,000’ers. It was a feat of creativity as much as raw physical talent, and it changed the way people view these mountains. Climbers now routinely attempt multiple 8,000-meter peaks in a season.

Non-climbers sometimes struggle to comprehend the nuances of what makes certain routes difficult. But they do understand a story. And that’s what Nims gave them. It’s neither alpinism nor speed climbing but something altogether new. He called it, unsurprisingly, “Nims style.” It’s less an unknown runner turning in a sub-two-hour marathon than somebody with a healthy appetite and determination realizing that they can wipe out the buffet at Bob’s Big Boy. It’s a spectacle. It’s a campaign. It’s because it’s there. 

One person who was deeply affected by Nims’s new benchmark was a bubbly, dreadlocked 36-year-old skier and runner from Norway named Kristin Harila. Though she hadn’t climbed a single 8,000’er before 2021, last year she decided to break Nims’s record. After stacking up sponsors, she hired a manager, and was guided by Sherpas Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa. In late September, with 12 peaks down, Harila was comfortably outpacing Nims, but the Chinese government wouldn’t give her a permit to climb Shishapangma and Cho Oyu. That ended her run. It was, in fact, logistics that defeated her. She plans to try again in 2023.

But while Nims’s feats have inspired some, his particular communication style really fires up critics. In the book and movie, as much as in conversation, Nims routinely lapses into one-liners and aphorisms as if his life were in fact a screenplay. During an early rescue in 14 Peaks, he shouts, “Giving up is not in the blood!” which has become his catchphrase. It’s on a T-shirt. He makes extraordinary claims that are difficult to confirm, which produces skepticism in any rational person receiving his story.

At times, Nims has lashed out at reporters for questioning his version of events or attempting to learn about his expeditions without passing through him first. Explorersweb, a small but committed online journal about mountaineering, is among the few to attempt to verify Nims’s claims. “Your information has always been crap,” he wrote on Instagram last May after a reporter questioned whether he and Qatari princess Asma Al Thani had started a climb from Camp Two instead of base camp. (Nims says they hadn’t.) The irony is that, as a media property, Nims far outstrips any of the climbing publications that would seek to cover him. And since he insists on controlling the narrative, the only source for info on Nims’s capers ends up being Nims himself. 

“My story, I didn’t ever want it to be told by anyone else, because that will never do it justice,” he told me. 

Take, for example, the time he was shot by a sniper in Afghanistan. “I tasted the warm, metallic tang of blood in my mouth,” Nims writes in Beyond Possible. “A puddle of red grew around me on the floor. For a split second I worried half my face had been shredded away, though I didn’t feel any pain.” Then he discovers that the bullet struck his rifle, not his face, and that he is fine. Still, the puddle of blood! Nims has no obvious scars on his face, and the Royal Navy doesn’t comment on such matters. It’s not that it couldn’t have happened exactly the way he wrote it. But it’s the type of facile twist that feels too cute for real life, like a sheriff’s badge stopping a bullet in a Western.

Nims’s story is full of these pulpy bits. Like when, as a child, he tests himself by swimming across a river near Chitwan and realizes he hasn’t reserved any stamina to get back (straight out of Gattaca), or when he discovers he’s out of shape at Annapurna and trains with boulders (Rocky IV).

A rising tide lifts all boats.” The models Madison was referring to were known collectively as the @SwissAlpineGirls. When I rolled into base camp, they were with another Elite detachment over on Lobuche East, a nearby 6,100-meter peak that Nims often advises novices to tackle as their first Himalayan ascent. Among the other clients on Lobuche was Andrew Shaw, who calls himself a “well-being engineer.” Nims’s appeal seems especially strong among the aesthetically inclined, probably due in part to his outsize digital footprint. But if the social media set was drawn to Nims, the climbing world wasn’t sure what to do with him. Mountaineers knew that Nims had accomplished something significant, but they couldn’t agree on what exactly that was. He had used some of the accoutrements frowned upon by purists, including bottled oxygen and fixed ropes, and had a team of Sherpas guide him in the way that a pace line of seasoned domestiques slices through wind resistance for the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. Krzysztof Wielicki, the legendary Polish mountaineer who in 1980 became the first to climb Everest in winter, told a Polish radio station, “It’s more of a statistical achievement,” adding that the feat would not be “written into the history of alpine climbing.” He felt that others had summited the 14 peaks in a far more impressive fashion, among them the South Tyrolean great Reinhold Messner, now 78, who achieved the feat in 16 years without fixed ropes or bottled oxygen, and the late Pole Jerzy Kukuczka, who pulled it off in eight years and used oxygen only on Everest. “It is light-years short of Kukuczka and Messner’s class,” Wielicki said of Nims’s Project Possible. But he failed to grasp the significance of Nims’s innovation, like the guy who stands in front of a Pollock and says, “My kid could do that.” Filmmaker and climber Jimmy Chin points out that while it is a logistical feat, “It’s way more than that…. You still have to climb the mountains”—often in bad weather. ADVERTISEMENT Nims receiving radio communications in base camp. Nims receiving radio communications in base camp. The fact is, before Nims did it in 189 days, nobody had even considered attempting a fastest known time (FKT) on the 8,000’ers. It was a feat of creativity as much as raw physical talent, and it changed the way people view these mountains. Climbers now routinely attempt multiple 8,000-meter peaks in a season. Non-climbers sometimes struggle to comprehend the nuances of what makes certain routes difficult. But they do understand a story. And that’s what Nims gave them. It’s neither alpinism nor speed climbing but something altogether new. He called it, unsurprisingly, “Nims style.” It’s less an unknown runner turning in a sub-two-hour marathon than somebody with a healthy appetite and determination realizing that they can wipe out the buffet at Bob’s Big Boy. It’s a spectacle. It’s a campaign. It’s because it’s there. One person who was deeply affected by Nims’s new benchmark was a bubbly, dreadlocked 36-year-old skier and runner from Norway named Kristin Harila. Though she hadn’t climbed a single 8,000’er before 2021, last year she decided to break Nims’s record. After stacking up sponsors, she hired a manager, and was guided by Sherpas Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa. In late September, with 12 peaks down, Harila was comfortably outpacing Nims, but the Chinese government wouldn’t give her a permit to climb Shishapangma and Cho Oyu. That ended her run. It was, in fact, logistics that defeated her. She plans to try again in 2023. But while Nims’s feats have inspired some, his particular communication style really fires up critics. In the book and movie, as much as in conversation, Nims routinely lapses into one-liners and aphorisms as if his life were in fact a screenplay. During an early rescue in 14 Peaks, he shouts, “Giving up is not in the blood!” which has become his catchphrase. It’s on a T-shirt. He makes extraordinary claims that are difficult to confirm, which produces skepticism in any rational person receiving his story. ADVERTISEMENT At times, Nims has lashed out at reporters for questioning his version of events or attempting to learn about his expeditions without passing through him first. Explorersweb, a small but committed online journal about mountaineering, is among the few to attempt to verify Nims’s claims. “Your information has always been crap,” he wrote on Instagram last May after a reporter questioned whether he and Qatari princess Asma Al Thani had started a climb from Camp Two instead of base camp. (Nims says they hadn’t.) The irony is that, as a media property, Nims far outstrips any of the climbing publications that would seek to cover him. And since he insists on controlling the narrative, the only source for info on Nims’s capers ends up being Nims himself. “My story, I didn’t ever want it to be told by anyone else, because that will never do it justice,” he told me. Take, for example, the time he was shot by a sniper in Afghanistan. “I tasted the warm, metallic tang of blood in my mouth,” Nims writes in Beyond Possible. “A puddle of red grew around me on the floor. For a split second I worried half my face had been shredded away, though I didn’t feel any pain.” Then he discovers that the bullet struck his rifle, not his face, and that he is fine. Still, the puddle of blood! Nims has no obvious scars on his face, and the Royal Navy doesn’t comment on such matters. It’s not that it couldn’t have happened exactly the way he wrote it. But it’s the type of facile twist that feels too cute for real life, like a sheriff’s badge stopping a bullet in a Western. A helicopter arrives on the wide plain where Nims's team set up base camp for their ascent of Ama Dablam. A helicopter arrives on the wide plain where Nims's team set up base camp for their ascent of Ama Dablam. Nims’s story is full of these pulpy bits.

 Hello These days, it’s a rare thing to see Nims face defeat. Over the past four years, the former Nepalese special forces soldier has electrified the climbing world and the wider culture beyond. He became mega-famous in 2019 by scaling all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter peaks in just six months and six days. After that inventive feat, his notoriety was multiplied by the releases of his book, Beyond Possible, and Netflix movie, 14 Peaks, both of which helped confer a level of power on Nims that climbers seldom achieve. Now he’s deciding how to wield that influence, both for himself and his Sherpa compatriots. He’s aimed at nothing less than remaking the Himalayan guiding industry in his image—and along the way is raising questions about what it means to be a mountaineer in the age of the influencer. WATCH Raheem Sterling Reviews His Best England Teammates | Game Points Having arranged to meet Nims at his camp at the base of Ama Dablam, where he was leading his final Himalayan expedition of the year, I’d flown by helicopter from Kathmandu to the roadless Sherpa capital of Namche Bazaar, located at just over 11,000 feet. From there, it was a three-day walk up Nepal’s Khumbu Valley to the tent city occupied by Elite Exped, which Nims operates with two Sherpa business partners, Mingma David and Mingma Tenzi. Roughly two dozen clients had ponied up about $11,000 each to share a rope with one of Nims’s Sherpa guides on the 25-day expedition, which would involve about a week of acclimatization followed by a grueling two-day summit push. In addition to Elite, there were a dozen or so other outfitters on the mountain, but the teams didn’t mix. Like the fancy camps at Burning Man, Elite was roped off with tasteful signs advising “No entry.” ADVERTISEMENT The scene at Nimss ultra lavish 65tent base camp. The scene at Nims’s ultra lavish, 65-tent base camp. Dominating camp were a pair of 30-foot-tall dome tents, inside which the climbers took their meals. At dinner that night, Nims sat at the head of a T-shaped banquet table in one of the two domes. He gave a weather report and dispensed customized summit plans for each client-Sherpa team from memory. He was surrounded by his patrons, among them several jovial, square-jawed British special-forces alums of the sort who now have successful life-hacking podcasts and large social media followings. Propane heaters purred, and a dozen of his climbers—the ones not currently acclimatizing higher up the mountain—sat noshing in comfortable armchairs. There was Madison Loyola, an athletic former LDS 30-something with a successful manufacturing company. Kayla Perez, a private-jet flight attendant had googled “how to climb a mountain” early in the pandemic; now she was here. Michael Green was a Vancouver-based architect who’d figured out how to build timber skyscrapers and gave a TED talk about it, with over a million views. After dinner, the Sherpas cranked up a local Nepali DJ named Badal and the scene phase-changed into a full-blown dance party. A fifth of rum appeared and Nims filled everyone’s cups. Green, the architect, leaned over and assured me, “This is every night.” “I don’t care what you do,” Nims later said of his policy on both clients and employees getting turnt. “But next day if you can’t operate, that’s your fuckup.” Nims danced for a half-hour, dropping into thigh-crushing Cossack leg kicks at one point, and then settled into a chair with a mug. Earlier in the day he’d been irritated that a French climber had died during his descent, and that his outfitter hadn’t called Nims to ask for help. “If only they had told my team, ‘Could you give us a hand?’ ” Nims lamented, referring to the staff of 46 able-bodied men in camp. “I have such huge manpower here.” ADVERTISEMENT Nims typically has a knack for being near the center of the action. His photo of a traffic jam of hundreds of climbers queuing near Everest’s summit in 2019 became an international news story, as were his many rescues of other climbers that same season. Last September, he organized the recovery of American ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson’s body after she died falling from the summit of Manaslu, the world’s eighth-tallest peak. But this time, there was nothing he could do. The guides had gotten the Frenchman off the mountain, but he expired before they could reach a waiting helicopter. The incident had prompted Nims to reflect on his own safety record. “Thirty-two 8,000-meter expeditions, my brother,” he boasted. “All summits. Brought everybody back home exactly the same way they left. Probably fitter and with a better mental attitude. No one in the world has got that track record. I say that with pride.” In 2021 Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of... In 2021, Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of bottled oxygen. Nims projects the kind of confidence that isn’t long suffered by these mountains. But what happens when someone does die? How would he respond to that? “No one should die,” Nims insisted. “There’s no What if? bro.” For Nims, this absolute belief seems less like denial than the daily affirmations of a man who makes Norman Vincent Peale look like a whiner. Nims has a lot of care for his clients and holds his Sherpa team in the highest regard. He believes he’s carrying more than their safety on his back. He nodded to the Sherpa guys still dancing. “I’m the fucking face of these people, bro,” he said. “You’ll see it everywhere in Kathmandu. I’m their hope now.” Indeed, his name was everywhere in Kathmandu, like a flickering signal resolving from the noise of interstellar static. A wobble in an orbit. A telltale shift in wavelength. A new and powerful force had taken hold here: Nimsdai. In sleek black sans serif on the hood of the custom white Land Rover that fetched me from Tribhuvan airport: Nimsdai. ADVERTISEMENT Those same seven letters appeared above the glass-and-steel shopping pavilion annexed to the five-star Marriott that sprang up in the brief interlude between the 2015 earthquake, which killed nearly 9,000 Nepalis, and the pandemic, which took an additional 12,000. Nimsdai is both the flagship mountaineering store above the Apple computer retailer in that square, and the diminutive Nepali call sign of the man whose name is on every Himalayan climber’s lips: Nirmal Purja a.k.a. Nims Purja a.k.a. Nimsdai. It means “Brother Nims.” He is family. He is a demigod. He is the second coming of Tenzing Norgay. Only this time, instead of politely supporting his Edmund Hillary, he takes the credit and razzes the best foreign climbers for drafting behind him and his Sherpa crew. Though he is now in possession of a British passport, Nims was once a barefoot ethnic Magar kid, running in the sweltering streets of Chitwan, near the Indian border. He was one of those uniformed boarding-school boys walking arm-in-arm in the road, dressed in a striped tie and a blue cardigan. That was before he joined the Gurkhas, the legendary Nepali infantrymen established by the British Empire, and then, through sheer force of will, became the first Nepali elevated to the Special Boat Service, the Royal Navy’s version of the SEALs. This, despite Nepal’s nonexistent coastline. Nims started out humble. The humility wore off. Like the punch line to that joke about how you know there’s a Navy SEAL in the room: He tells you of his deeds, his world records, his daring rescues. He has compared himself to Muhammad Ali, Usain Bolt, Neil Armstrong, and Robin Hood, and speaks slogan-ese with a fluency that could reanimate Ron Popeil. Achieve your new possible! Always a little higher! Giving up is not in the blood! These and other phrases are printed on everything from coffee cups to the mission patches Nims velcros to the one-piece down summit suits worn by his mountaineer clients. He says he’s the CEO of nine companies, though he won’t name them all. His book and movie are both autobiographical. The former, a best seller, reads like the kind of memoir written by American politicians who have suddenly taken to vacationing in Iowa. The latter, Nims says, was Netflix’s most popular release of 2021. He gets consistent corporate speaking gigs, and his one-on-one guiding rate up Everest is, he told me, more than a million dollars. At night Nimss Ama Dablam base camp often turns into a disco. The mountaineer has a simple policy on boozing at altitude... At night, Nims’s Ama Dablam base camp often turns into a disco. The mountaineer has a simple policy on boozing at altitude: “Next day if you can’t come and operate, that’s your fuckup.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s a lot. Nims is a lot. But his hustle and bravado are precisely the things that have allowed him to break into the mainstream from Nepal’s deep bench of climbing talent. I’ve covered mountaineering and Sherpa culture on and off for more than a decade, and while there have always been insanely strong climbers with roots in Nepal, nobody has ever amassed the mind share, as the marketers say, that Nims has. In the process he’s gathered a legion of devotees and plenty of critics, all of them hoping to cement his reputation as either a generational talent among high-altitude mountaineers or else an egotistical self-promoter flying perilously close to the sun. I found it impossible to escape these questions in Kathmandu as I prepared to go meet the man himself. At the airport, I made my way beneath the rotors of an AStar B3, noticing before I climbed aboard that it was wrapped in now familiar black lettering: Nimsdai. The heli put me down in Namche Bazaar, which sits in an airy amphitheater of hillside high above the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and Bhote Koshi rivers. From a ridgeline above town, I could see Ama Dablam—“mother’s necklace”—a granite pinnacle adorned with a hundred-ton pendant of ice near its western crown. Farther in the background rises the squat pyramid of Everest, at 29,032 feet. Chomolungma, as the Sherpas call it, isn’t the prettiest, but it’s so high that it juts into the jet stream and makes a rooster tail in the stratosphere, like it’s clawing at space itself. Walking the dusty trail beside these mountains produces a kind of vertigo of naked scale. They follow you the way the moon does—Thamserku, Taboche, Cholatse. The path feels stationary, like a treadmill. For most of us, Himalayan peaks merely inspire awe. But to an unfortunate subset of climbers, they’re as irresistible as a wobbly bookcase is to a toddler. The tallest 14 of the world’s summits, through a chance intersection of geology and the metric system, are known as the 8,000’ers. Above 8,000 meters—about 26,000 feet—your body can no longer adapt to the thinness of the air. This is the Death Zone. You can’t stay here long. It was on these 14 peaks—all of them located in the Himalayan uplift in the border regions of Nepal, Tibet, and Pakistan—that Nims first blew minds. The Death Zone peaks are roughly sorted into three groups, based on those international borders. In Nepal: Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Manaslu. In the Pakistani Karakoram, 900 miles to the north and much colder: Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I and II, K2, and Broad Peak. Lastly, along Nepal’s border with Tibet: Cho Oyu and Shishapangma. He’d first begun climbing at altitude in 2012, at the age of 29, and four years later reached the summit of Everest as an anonymous client while on leave from the U.K. Special Forces. Then, in 2019, having previously climbed only four of the Death Zone peaks, Nims summited all 14 in just six months and six days. He called it Project Possible, because people who know about such things told him it couldn’t be done. The previous record was a brisk but sensible seven years—one expedition in each of the spring and fall climbing seasons, between the monsoons and the frigid winter. ADVERTISEMENT Bagging Himalayan peaks as if they were day-trip outings was unheard of. The movie Nims shot and produced debuted on Netflix in November 2021 and elevated Nims and his Sherpa team to social media celebrity status. The film also generated huge international publicity for Elite Exped. By mid-2022 Nims had over 2 million followers on Instagram. He also had a client list that he said included numerous billionaires, whose names he won’t reveal, and one Qatari princess, Asma Al Thani, who appears frequently in his feed.

That was before he joined the Gurkhas, the legendary Nepali infantrymen established by the British Empire, and then, through sheer force of will, became the first Nepali elevated to the Special Boat Service, the Royal Navy’s version of the SEALs. This, despite Nepal’s nonexistent coastline. Nims started out humble. The humility wore off. Like the punch line to that joke about how you know there’s a Navy SEAL in the room: He tells you of his deeds, his world records, his daring rescues. He has compared himself to Muhammad Ali, Usain Bolt, Neil Armstrong, and Robin Hood, and speaks slogan-ese with a fluency that could reanimate Ron Popeil. Achieve your new possible! Always a little higher! Giving up is not in the blood! These and other phrases are printed on everything from coffee cups to the mission patches Nims velcros to the one-piece down summit suits worn by his mountaineer clients. He says he’s the CEO of nine companies, though he won’t name them all. His book and movie are both autobiographical. The former, a best seller, reads like the kind of memoir written by American politicians who have suddenly taken to vacationing in Iowa. The latter, Nims says, was Netflix’s most popular release of 2021. He gets consistent corporate speaking gigs, and his one-on-one guiding rate up Everest is, he told me, more than a million dollars. At night Nimss Ama Dablam base camp often turns into a disco. The mountaineer has a simple policy on boozing at altitude... At night, Nims’s Ama Dablam base camp often turns into a disco. The mountaineer has a simple policy on boozing at altitude: “Next day if you can’t come and operate, that’s your fuckup.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s a lot. Nims is a lot. But his hustle and bravado are precisely the things that have allowed him to break into the mainstream from Nepal’s deep bench of climbing talent. I’ve covered mountaineering and Sherpa culture on and off for more than a decade, and while there have always been insanely strong climbers with roots in Nepal, nobody has ever amassed the mind share, as the marketers say, that Nims has. In the process he’s gathered a legion of devotees and plenty of critics, all of them hoping to cement his reputation as either a generational talent among high-altitude mountaineers or else an egotistical self-promoter flying perilously close to the sun. I found it impossible to escape these questions in Kathmandu as I prepared to go meet the man himself. At the airport, I made my way beneath the rotors of an AStar B3, noticing before I climbed aboard that it was wrapped in now familiar black lettering: Nimsdai. The heli put me down in Namche Bazaar, which sits in an airy amphitheater of hillside high above the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and Bhote Koshi rivers. From a ridgeline above town, I could see Ama Dablam—“mother’s necklace”—a granite pinnacle adorned with a hundred-ton pendant of ice near its western crown. Farther in the background rises the squat pyramid of Everest, at 29,032 feet. Chomolungma, as the Sherpas call it, isn’t the prettiest, but it’s so high that it juts into the jet stream and makes a rooster tail in the stratosphere, like it’s clawing at space itself. Walking the dusty trail beside these mountains produces a kind of vertigo of naked scale. They follow you the way the moon does—Thamserku, Taboche, Cholatse. The path feels stationary, like a treadmill. For most of us, Himalayan peaks merely inspire awe. But to an unfortunate subset of climbers, they’re as irresistible as a wobbly bookcase is to a toddler. The tallest 14 of the world’s summits, through a chance intersection of geology and the metric system, are known as the 8,000’ers. Above 8,000 meters—about 26,000 feet—your body can no longer adapt to the thinness of the air. This is the Death Zone. You can’t stay here long. It was on these 14 peaks—all of them located in the Himalayan uplift in the border regions of Nepal, Tibet, and Pakistan—that Nims first blew minds. The Death Zone peaks are roughly sorted into three groups, based on those international borders. In Nepal: Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Manaslu. In the Pakistani Karakoram, 900 miles to the north and much colder: Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I and II, K2, and Broad Peak. Lastly, along Nepal’s border with Tibet: Cho Oyu and Shishapangma. He’d first begun climbing at altitude in 2012, at the age of 29, and four years later reached the summit of Everest as an anonymous client while on leave from the U.K. Special Forces. Then, in 2019, having previously climbed only four of the Death Zone peaks, Nims summited all 14 in just six months and six days. He called it Project Possible, because people who know about such things told him it couldn’t be done. The previous record was a brisk but sensible seven years—one expedition in each of the spring and fall climbing seasons, between the monsoons and the frigid winter. ADVERTISEMENT Bagging Himalayan peaks as if they were day-trip outings was unheard of. The movie Nims shot and produced debuted on Netflix in November 2021 and elevated Nims and his Sherpa team to social media celebrity status. The film also generated huge international publicity for Elite Exped. By mid-2022 Nims had over 2 million followers on Instagram. He also had a client list that he said included numerous billionaires, whose names he won’t reveal, and one Qatari princess, Asma Al Thani, who appears frequently in his feed.

On the way to meet Nims, I sent a WhatsApp message to Garrett Madison, an American outfitter on Ama Dablam that fall, letting him know that I was coming. “Just visited Nims’s camp today,” Madison replied. “Only three models this time 😂.” Was Madison worried that Nimsdai and his Elite Exped would swallow up the entire Himalayan guiding industry? Not quite. It’s a “different vibe,” Madison responded. “Interesting ‘new market’ of clientele. Not my competition, so all good. A rising tide lifts all boats.” The models Madison was referring to were known collectively as the @SwissAlpineGirls. When I rolled into base camp, they were with another Elite detachment over on Lobuche East, a nearby 6,100-meter peak that Nims often advises novices to tackle as their first Himalayan ascent. Among the other clients on Lobuche was Andrew Shaw, who calls himself a “well-being engineer.” Nims’s appeal seems especially strong among the aesthetically inclined, probably due in part to his outsize digital footprint. But if the social media set was drawn to Nims, the climbing world wasn’t sure what to do with him. Mountaineers knew that Nims had accomplished something significant, but they couldn’t agree on what exactly that was. He had used some of the accoutrements frowned upon by purists, including bottled oxygen and fixed ropes, and had a team of Sherpas guide him in the way that a pace line of seasoned domestiques slices through wind resistance for the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. Krzysztof Wielicki, the legendary Polish mountaineer who in 1980 became the first to climb Everest in winter, told a Polish radio station, “It’s more of a statistical achievement,” adding that the feat would not be “written into the history of alpine climbing.” He felt that others had summited the 14 peaks in a far more impressive fashion, among them the South Tyrolean great Reinhold Messner, now 78, who achieved the feat in 16 years without fixed ropes or bottled oxygen, and the late Pole Jerzy Kukuczka, who pulled it off in eight years and used oxygen only on Everest. “It is light-years short of Kukuczka and Messner’s class,” Wielicki said of Nims’s Project Possible. But he failed to grasp the significance of Nims’s innovation, like the guy who stands in front of a Pollock and says, “My kid could do that.” Filmmaker and climber Jimmy Chin points out that while it is a logistical feat, “It’s way more than that…. You still have to climb the mountains”—often in bad weather. ADVERTISEMENT Nims receiving radio communications in base camp. Nims receiving radio communications in base camp. The fact is, before Nims did it in 189 days, nobody had even considered attempting a fastest known time (FKT) on the 8,000’ers. It was a feat of creativity as much as raw physical talent, and it changed the way people view these mountains. Climbers now routinely attempt multiple 8,000-meter peaks in a season. Non-climbers sometimes struggle to comprehend the nuances of what makes certain routes difficult. But they do understand a story. And that’s what Nims gave them. It’s neither alpinism nor speed climbing but something altogether new. He called it, unsurprisingly, “Nims style.” It’s less an unknown runner turning in a sub-two-hour marathon than somebody with a healthy appetite and determination realizing that they can wipe out the buffet at Bob’s Big Boy. It’s a spectacle. It’s a campaign. It’s because it’s there. One person who was deeply affected by Nims’s new benchmark was a bubbly, dreadlocked 36-year-old skier and runner from Norway named Kristin Harila. Though she hadn’t climbed a single 8,000’er before 2021, last year she decided to break Nims’s record. After stacking up sponsors, she hired a manager, and was guided by Sherpas Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa. In late September, with 12 peaks down, Harila was comfortably outpacing Nims, but the Chinese government wouldn’t give her a permit to climb Shishapangma and Cho Oyu. That ended her run. It was, in fact, logistics that defeated her. She plans to try again in 2023. But while Nims’s feats have inspired some, his particular communication style really fires up critics. In the book and movie, as much as in conversation, Nims routinely lapses into one-liners and aphorisms as if his life were in fact a screenplay. During an early rescue in 14 Peaks, he shouts, “Giving up is not in the blood!” which has become his catchphrase. It’s on a T-shirt. He makes extraordinary claims that are difficult to confirm, which produces skepticism in any rational person receiving his story. ADVERTISEMENT At times, Nims has lashed out at reporters for questioning his version of events or attempting to learn about his expeditions without passing through him first. Explorersweb, a small but committed online journal about mountaineering, is among the few to attempt to verify Nims’s claims. “Your information has always been crap,” he wrote on Instagram last May after a reporter questioned whether he and Qatari princess Asma Al Thani had started a climb from Camp Two instead of base camp. (Nims says they hadn’t.) The irony is that, as a media property, Nims far outstrips any of the climbing publications that would seek to cover him. And since he insists on controlling the narrative, the only source for info on Nims’s capers ends up being Nims himself. “My story, I didn’t ever want it to be told by anyone else, because that will never do it justice,” he told me. Take, for example, the time he was shot by a sniper in Afghanistan. “I tasted the warm, metallic tang of blood in my mouth,” Nims writes in Beyond Possible. “A puddle of red grew around me on the floor. For a split second I worried half my face had been shredded away, though I didn’t feel any pain.” Then he discovers that the bullet struck his rifle, not his face, and that he is fine. Still, the puddle of blood! Nims has no obvious scars on his face, and the Royal Navy doesn’t comment on such matters. It’s not that it couldn’t have happened exactly the way he wrote it. But it’s the type of facile twist that feels too cute for real life, like a sheriff’s badge stopping a bullet in a Western. A helicopter arrives on the wide plain where Nims's team set up base camp for their ascent of Ama Dablam.

  Hello These days, it’s a rare thing to see Nims face defeat. Over the past four years, the former Nepalese special forces soldier has electrified the climbing world and the wider culture beyond. He became mega-famous in 2019 by scaling all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter peaks in just six months and six days. After that inventive feat, his notoriety was multiplied by the releases of his book, Beyond Possible, and Netflix movie, 14 Peaks, both of which helped confer a level of power on Nims that climbers seldom achieve. Now he’s deciding how to wield that influence, both for himself and his Sherpa compatriots. He’s aimed at nothing less than remaking the Himalayan guiding industry in his image—and along the way is raising questions about what it means to be a mountaineer in the age of the influencer. WATCH Raheem Sterling Reviews His Best England Teammates | Game Points Having arranged to meet Nims at his camp at the base of Ama Dablam, where he was leading his final Himalayan expedition of the year, I’d flown by helicopter from Kathmandu to the roadless Sherpa capital of Namche Bazaar, located at just over 11,000 feet. From there, it was a three-day walk up Nepal’s Khumbu Valley to the tent city occupied by Elite Exped, which Nims operates with two Sherpa business partners, Mingma David and Mingma Tenzi. Roughly two dozen clients had ponied up about $11,000 each to share a rope with one of Nims’s Sherpa guides on the 25-day expedition, which would involve about a week of acclimatization followed by a grueling two-day summit push. In addition to Elite, there were a dozen or so other outfitters on the mountain, but the teams didn’t mix. Like the fancy camps at Burning Man, Elite was roped off with tasteful signs advising “No entry.” ADVERTISEMENT The scene at Nimss ultra lavish 65tent base camp. The scene at Nims’s ultra lavish, 65-tent base camp. Dominating camp were a pair of 30-foot-tall dome tents, inside which the climbers took their meals. At dinner that night, Nims sat at the head of a T-shaped banquet table in one of the two domes. He gave a weather report and dispensed customized summit plans for each client-Sherpa team from memory. He was surrounded by his patrons, among them several jovial, square-jawed British special-forces alums of the sort who now have successful life-hacking podcasts and large social media followings. Propane heaters purred, and a dozen of his climbers—the ones not currently acclimatizing higher up the mountain—sat noshing in comfortable armchairs. There was Madison Loyola, an athletic former LDS 30-something with a successful manufacturing company. Kayla Perez, a private-jet flight attendant had googled “how to climb a mountain” early in the pandemic; now she was here. Michael Green was a Vancouver-based architect who’d figured out how to build timber skyscrapers and gave a TED talk about it, with over a million views. After dinner, the Sherpas cranked up a local Nepali DJ named Badal and the scene phase-changed into a full-blown dance party. A fifth of rum appeared and Nims filled everyone’s cups. Green, the architect, leaned over and assured me, “This is every night.” “I don’t care what you do,” Nims later said of his policy on both clients and employees getting turnt. “But next day if you can’t operate, that’s your fuckup.” Nims danced for a half-hour, dropping into thigh-crushing Cossack leg kicks at one point, and then settled into a chair with a mug. Earlier in the day he’d been irritated that a French climber had died during his descent, and that his outfitter hadn’t called Nims to ask for help. “If only they had told my team, ‘Could you give us a hand?’ ” Nims lamented, referring to the staff of 46 able-bodied men in camp. “I have such huge manpower here.” ADVERTISEMENT Nims typically has a knack for being near the center of the action. His photo of a traffic jam of hundreds of climbers queuing near Everest’s summit in 2019 became an international news story, as were his many rescues of other climbers that same season. Last September, he organized the recovery of American ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson’s body after she died falling from the summit of Manaslu, the world’s eighth-tallest peak. But this time, there was nothing he could do. The guides had gotten the Frenchman off the mountain, but he expired before they could reach a waiting helicopter. The incident had prompted Nims to reflect on his own safety record. “Thirty-two 8,000-meter expeditions, my brother,” he boasted. “All summits. Brought everybody back home exactly the same way they left. Probably fitter and with a better mental attitude. No one in the world has got that track record. I say that with pride.” In 2021 Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of... In 2021, Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of bottled oxygen. Nims projects the kind of confidence that isn’t long suffered by these mountains. But what happens when someone does die? How would he respond to that? “No one should die,” Nims insisted. “There’s no What if? bro.” For Nims, this absolute belief seems less like denial than the daily affirmations of a man who makes Norman Vincent Peale look like a whiner. Nims has a lot of care for his clients and holds his Sherpa team in the highest regard. He believes he’s carrying more than their safety on his back. He nodded to the Sherpa guys still dancing. “I’m the fucking face of these people, bro,” he said. “You’ll see it everywhere in Kathmandu. I’m their hope now.” Indeed, his name was everywhere in Kathmandu, like a flickering signal resolving from the noise of interstellar static. A wobble in an orbit. A telltale shift in wavelength. A new and powerful force had taken hold here: Nimsdai. In sleek black sans serif on the hood of the custom white Land Rover that fetched me from Tribhuvan airport: Nimsdai. ADVERTISEMENT Those same seven letters appeared above the glass-and-steel shopping pavilion annexed to the five-star Marriott that sprang up in the brief interlude between the 2015 earthquake, which killed nearly 9,000 Nepalis, and the pandemic, which took an additional 12,000. Nimsdai is both the flagship mountaineering store above the Apple computer retailer in that square, and the diminutive Nepali call sign of the man whose name is on every Himalayan climber’s lips: Nirmal Purja a.k.a. Nims Purja a.k.a. Nimsdai. It means “Brother Nims.” He is family. He is a demigod. He is the second coming of Tenzing Norgay. Only this time, instead of politely supporting his Edmund Hillary, he takes the credit and razzes the best foreign climbers for drafting behind him and his Sherpa crew. Though he is now in possession of a British passport, Nims was once a barefoot ethnic Magar kid, running in the sweltering streets of Chitwan, near the Indian border. He was one of those uniformed boarding-school boys walking arm-in-arm in the road, dressed in a striped tie and a blue cardigan. That was before he joined the Gurkhas, the legendary Nepali infantrymen established by the British Empire, and then, through sheer force of will, became the first Nepali elevated to the Special Boat Service, the Royal Navy’s version of the SEALs.

WATCH Raheem Sterling Reviews His Best England Teammates | Game Points Having arranged to meet Nims at his camp at the base of Ama Dablam, where he was leading his final Himalayan expedition of the year, I’d flown by helicopter from Kathmandu to the roadless Sherpa capital of Namche Bazaar, located at just over 11,000 feet. From there, it was a three-day walk up Nepal’s Khumbu Valley to the tent city occupied by Elite Exped, which Nims operates with two Sherpa business partners, Mingma David and Mingma Tenzi. Roughly two dozen clients had ponied up about $11,000 each to share a rope with one of Nims’s Sherpa guides on the 25-day expedition, which would involve about a week of acclimatization followed by a grueling two-day summit push. In addition to Elite, there were a dozen or so other outfitters on the mountain, but the teams didn’t mix. Like the fancy camps at Burning Man, Elite was roped off with tasteful signs advising “No entry.” ADVERTISEMENT The scene at Nimss ultra lavish 65tent base camp. The scene at Nims’s ultra lavish, 65-tent base camp. Dominating camp were a pair of 30-foot-tall dome tents, inside which the climbers took their meals. At dinner that night, Nims sat at the head of a T-shaped banquet table in one of the two domes. He gave a weather report and dispensed customized summit plans for each client-Sherpa team from memory. He was surrounded by his patrons, among them several jovial, square-jawed British special-forces alums of the sort who now have successful life-hacking podcasts and large social media followings. Propane heaters purred, and a dozen of his climbers—the ones not currently acclimatizing higher up the mountain—sat noshing in comfortable armchairs. There was Madison Loyola, an athletic former LDS 30-something with a successful manufacturing company. Kayla Perez, a private-jet flight attendant had googled “how to climb a mountain” early in the pandemic; now she was here. Michael Green was a Vancouver-based architect who’d figured out how to build timber skyscrapers and gave a TED talk about it, with over a million views. After dinner, the Sherpas cranked up a local Nepali DJ named Badal and the scene phase-changed into a full-blown dance party. A fifth of rum appeared and Nims filled everyone’s cups. Green, the architect, leaned over and assured me, “This is every night.” “I don’t care what you do,” Nims later said of his policy on both clients and employees getting turnt. “But next day if you can’t operate, that’s your fuckup.” Nims danced for a half-hour, dropping into thigh-crushing Cossack leg kicks at one point, and then settled into a chair with a mug. Earlier in the day he’d been irritated that a French climber had died during his descent, and that his outfitter hadn’t called Nims to ask for help. “If only they had told my team, ‘Could you give us a hand?’ ” Nims lamented, referring to the staff of 46 able-bodied men in camp. “I have such huge manpower here.” ADVERTISEMENT Nims typically has a knack for being near the center of the action. His photo of a traffic jam of hundreds of climbers queuing near Everest’s summit in 2019 became an international news story, as were his many rescues of other climbers that same season. Last September, he organized the recovery of American ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson’s body after she died falling from the summit of Manaslu, the world’s eighth-tallest peak. But this time, there was nothing he could do. The guides had gotten the Frenchman off the mountain, but he expired before they could reach a waiting helicopter. The incident had prompted Nims to reflect on his own safety record. “Thirty-two 8,000-meter expeditions, my brother,” he boasted. “All summits. Brought everybody back home exactly the same way they left. Probably fitter and with a better mental attitude. No one in the world has got that track record. I say that with pride.” In 2021 Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of... In 2021, Nims became the first person to ever summit K2 in winter—a feat he staggeringly accomplished without the aid of bottled oxygen. Nims projects the kind of confidence that isn’t long suffered by these mountains. But what happens when someone does die? How would he respond to that? “No one should die,” Nims insisted. “There’s no What if? bro.” For Nims, this absolute belief seems less like denial than the daily affirmations of a man who makes Norman Vincent Peale look like a whiner. Nims has a lot of care for his clients and holds his Sherpa team in the highest regard. He believes he’s carrying more than their safety on his back. He nodded to the Sherpa guys still dancing. “I’m the fucking face of these people, bro,” he said. “You’ll see it everywhere in Kathmandu. I’m their hope now.” Indeed, his name was everywhere in Kathmandu, like a flickering signal resolving from the noise of interstellar static. A wobble in an orbit. A telltale shift in wavelength. A new and powerful force had taken hold here: Nimsdai. In sleek black sans serif on the hood of the custom white Land Rover that fetched me from Tribhuvan airport: Nimsdai. ADVERTISEMENT Those same seven letters appeared above the glass-and-steel shopping pavilion annexed to the five-star Marriott that sprang up in the brief interlude between the 2015 earthquake, which killed nearly 9,000 Nepalis, and the pandemic, which took an additional 12,000. Nimsdai is both the flagship mountaineering store above the Apple computer retailer in that square, and the diminutive Nepali call sign of the man whose name is on every Himalayan climber’s lips: Nirmal Purja a.k.a. Nims Purja a.k.a. Nimsdai. It means “Brother Nims.” He is family. He is a demigod. He is the second coming of Tenzing Norgay. Only this time, instead of politely supporting his Edmund Hillary, he takes the credit and razzes the best foreign climbers for drafting behind him and his Sherpa crew. Though he is now in possession of a British passport, Nims was once a barefoot ethnic Magar kid, running in the sweltering streets of Chitwan, near the Indian border. He was one of those uniformed boarding-school boys walking arm-in-arm in the road, dressed in a striped tie and a blue cardigan. That was before he joined the Gurkhas, the legendary Nepali infantrymen established by the British Empire, and then, through sheer force of will, became the first Nepali elevated to the Special Boat Service, the Royal Navy’s version of the SEALs. This, despite Nepal’s nonexistent coastline. Nims started out humble. The humility wore off. Like the punch line to that joke about how you know there’s a Navy SEAL in the room: He tells you of his deeds, his world records, his daring rescues. He has compared himself to Muhammad Ali, Usain Bolt, Neil Armstrong, and Robin Hood, and speaks slogan-ese with a fluency that could reanimate Ron Popeil. Achieve your new possible! Always a little higher! Giving up is not in the blood! These and other phrases are printed on everything from coffee cups to the mission patches Nims velcros to the one-piece down summit suits worn by his mountaineer clients. He says he’s the CEO of nine companies, though he won’t name them all. His book and movie are both autobiographical. The former, a best seller, reads like the kind of memoir written by American politicians who have suddenly taken to vacationing in Iowa. The latter, Nims says, was Netflix’s most popular release of 2021. He gets consistent corporate speaking gigs, and his one-on-one guiding rate up Everest is, he told me, more than a million dollars.

The mountaineer has a simple policy on boozing at altitude: “Next day if you can’t come and operate, that’s your fuckup.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s a lot. Nims is a lot. But his hustle and bravado are precisely the things that have allowed him to break into the mainstream from Nepal’s deep bench of climbing talent. I’ve covered mountaineering and Sherpa culture on and off for more than a decade, and while there have always been insanely strong climbers with roots in Nepal, nobody has ever amassed the mind share, as the marketers say, that Nims has. In the process he’s gathered a legion of devotees and plenty of critics, all of them hoping to cement his reputation as either a generational talent among high-altitude mountaineers or else an egotistical self-promoter flying perilously close to the sun. I found it impossible to escape these questions in Kathmandu as I prepared to go meet the man himself. At the airport, I made my way beneath the rotors of an AStar B3, noticing before I climbed aboard that it was wrapped in now familiar black lettering: Nimsdai. The heli put me down in Namche Bazaar, which sits in an airy amphitheater of hillside high above the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and Bhote Koshi rivers. From a ridgeline above town, I could see Ama Dablam—“mother’s necklace”—a granite pinnacle adorned with a hundred-ton pendant of ice near its western crown. Farther in the background rises the squat pyramid of Everest, at 29,032 feet. Chomolungma, as the Sherpas call it, isn’t the prettiest, but it’s so high that it juts into the jet stream and makes a rooster tail in the stratosphere, like it’s clawing at space itself. Walking the dusty trail beside these mountains produces a kind of vertigo of naked scale. They follow you the way the moon does—Thamserku, Taboche, Cholatse. The path feels stationary, like a treadmill. For most of us, Himalayan peaks merely inspire awe. But to an unfortunate subset of climbers, they’re as irresistible as a wobbly bookcase is to a toddler. The tallest 14 of the world’s summits, through a chance intersection of geology and the metric system, are known as the 8,000’ers. Above 8,000 meters—about 26,000 feet—your body can no longer adapt to the thinness of the air. This is the Death Zone. You can’t stay here long. It was on these 14 peaks—all of them located in the Himalayan uplift in the border regions of Nepal, Tibet, and Pakistan—that Nims first blew minds. The Death Zone peaks are roughly sorted into three groups, based on those international borders. In Nepal: Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Manaslu. In the Pakistani Karakoram, 900 miles to the north and much colder: Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I and II, K2, and Broad Peak. Lastly, along Nepal’s border with Tibet: Cho Oyu and Shishapangma. He’d first begun climbing at altitude in 2012, at the age of 29, and four years later reached the summit of Everest as an anonymous client while on leave from the U.K. Special Forces. Then, in 2019, having previously climbed only four of the Death Zone peaks, Nims summited all 14 in just six months and six days. He called it Project Possible, because people who know about such things told him it couldn’t be done. The previous record was a brisk but sensible seven years—one expedition in each of the spring and fall climbing seasons, between the monsoons and the frigid winter. ADVERTISEMENT Bagging Himalayan peaks as if they were day-trip outings was unheard of. The movie Nims shot and produced debuted on Netflix in November 2021 and elevated Nims and his Sherpa team to social media celebrity status. The film also generated huge international publicity for Elite Exped. By mid-2022 Nims had over 2 million followers on Instagram. He also had a client list that he said included numerous billionaires, whose names he won’t reveal, and one Qatari princess, Asma Al Thani, who appears frequently in his feed.

On the way to meet Nims, I sent a WhatsApp message to Garrett Madison, an American outfitter on Ama Dablam that fall, letting him know that I was coming. “Just visited Nims’s camp today,” Madison replied. “Only three models this time 😂.” Was Madison worried that Nimsdai and his Elite Exped would swallow up the entire Himalayan guiding industry? Not quite. It’s a “different vibe,” Madison responded. “Interesting ‘new market’ of clientele. Not my competition, so all good. A rising tide lifts all boats.” The models Madison was referring to were known collectively as the @SwissAlpineGirls. When I rolled into base camp, they were with another Elite detachment over on Lobuche East, a nearby 6,100-meter peak that Nims often advises novices to tackle as their first Himalayan ascent. Among the other clients on Lobuche was Andrew Shaw, who calls himself a “well-being engineer.” Nims’s appeal seems especially strong among the aesthetically inclined, probably due in part to his outsize digital footprint. But if the social media set was drawn to Nims, the climbing world wasn’t sure what to do with him. Mountaineers knew that Nims had accomplished something significant, but they couldn’t agree on what exactly that was. He had used some of the accoutrements frowned upon by purists, including bottled oxygen and fixed ropes, and had a team of Sherpas guide him in the way that a pace line of seasoned domestiques slices through wind resistance for the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. Krzysztof Wielicki, the legendary Polish mountaineer who in 1980 became the first to climb Everest in winter, told a Polish radio station, “It’s more of a statistical achievement,” adding that the feat would not be “written into the history of alpine climbing.” He felt that others had summited the 14 peaks in a far more impressive fashion, among them the South Tyrolean great Reinhold Messner, now 78, who achieved the feat in 16 years without fixed ropes or bottled oxygen, and the late Pole Jerzy Kukuczka, who pulled it off in eight years and used oxygen only on Everest. “It is light-years short of Kukuczka and Messner’s class,” Wielicki said of Nims’s Project Possible. But he failed to grasp the significance of Nims’s innovation, like the guy who stands in front of a Pollock and says, “My kid could do that.” Filmmaker and climber Jimmy Chin points out that while it is a logistical feat, “It’s way more than that…. You still have to climb the mountains”—often in bad weather. ADVERTISEMENT Nims receiving radio communications in base camp. Nims receiving radio communications in base camp. The fact is, before Nims did it in 189 days, nobody had even considered attempting a fastest known time (FKT) on the 8,000’ers. It was a feat of creativity as much as raw physical talent, and it changed the way people view these mountains. Climbers now routinely attempt multiple 8,000-meter peaks in a season. Non-climbers sometimes struggle to comprehend the nuances of what makes certain routes difficult. But they do understand a story. And that’s what Nims gave them. It’s neither alpinism nor speed climbing but something altogether new. He called it, unsurprisingly, “Nims style.” It’s less an unknown runner turning in a sub-two-hour marathon than somebody with a healthy appetite and determination realizing that they can wipe out the buffet at Bob’s Big Boy. It’s a spectacle. It’s a campaign. It’s because it’s there. One person who was deeply affected by Nims’s new benchmark was a bubbly, dreadlocked 36-year-old skier and runner from Norway named Kristin Harila. Though she hadn’t climbed a single 8,000’er before 2021, last year she decided to break Nims’s record. After stacking up sponsors, she hired a manager, and was guided by Sherpas Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa. In late September, with 12 peaks down, Harila was comfortably outpacing Nims, but the Chinese government wouldn’t give her a permit to climb Shishapangma and Cho Oyu. That ended her run. It was, in fact, logistics that defeated her. She plans to try again in 2023. But while Nims’s feats have inspired some, his particular communication style really fires up critics. In the book and movie, as much as in conversation, Nims routinely lapses into one-liners and aphorisms as if his life were in fact a screenplay. During an early rescue in 14 Peaks, he shouts, “Giving up is not in the blood!” which has become his catchphrase. It’s on a T-shirt. He makes extraordinary claims that are difficult to confirm, which produces skepticism in any rational person receiving his story. ADVERTISEMENT At times, Nims has lashed out at reporters for questioning his version of events or attempting to learn about his expeditions without passing through him first. Explorersweb, a small but committed online journal about mountaineering, is among the few to attempt to verify Nims’s claims. “Your information has always been crap,” he wrote on Instagram last May after a reporter questioned whether he and Qatari princess Asma Al Thani had started a climb from Camp Two instead of base camp. (Nims says they hadn’t.) The irony is that, as a media property, Nims far outstrips any of the climbing publications that would seek to cover him. And since he insists on controlling the narrative, the only source for info on Nims’s capers ends up being Nims himself. “My story, I didn’t ever want it to be told by anyone else, because that will never do it justice,” he told me. Take, for example, the time he was shot by a sniper in Afghanistan. “I tasted the warm, metallic tang of blood in my mouth,” Nims writes in Beyond Possible. “A puddle of red grew around me on the floor. For a split second I worried half my face had been shredded away, though I didn’t feel any pain.” Then he discovers that the bullet struck his rifle, not his face, and that he is fine. Still, the puddle of blood! Nims has no obvious scars on his face, and the Royal Navy doesn’t comment on such matters. It’s not that it couldn’t have happened exactly the way he wrote it. But it’s the type of facile twist that feels too cute for real life, like a sheriff’s badge stopping a bullet in a Western. A helicopter arrives on the wide plain where Nims's team set up base camp for their ascent of Ama Dablam. A helicopter arrives on the wide plain where Nims's team set up base camp for their ascent of Ama Dablam. Nims’s story is full of these pulpy bits. Like when, as a child, he tests himself by swimming across a river near Chitwan and realizes he hasn’t reserved any stamina to get back (straight out of Gattaca), or when he discovers he’s out of shape at Annapurna and trains with boulders
